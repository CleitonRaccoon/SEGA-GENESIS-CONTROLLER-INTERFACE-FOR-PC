# SEGA-GENESIS-CONTROLLER-INTERFACE-FOR-PC
Arduino UNO interface for sega genesis controller

Hi I made this proyect originaly to let my girlfriend play sonic on real hardware on my sega trough parsec but found it has a  lot more uses than that, this little bundle lets you use any controller on your sega genesis as long as windows recognizes it as a xbox 360 controller
